## Introduction 

Welcome! In this tutorial, we'll learn R functions that can help us wrangle, summarize, and visualize your survey responses and learn a little more about you! 

### Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse**, "an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.” 

Run the code to load the **tidyverse**.

```{r load-packages, exercise = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

### Your survey responses 

The data set `responses` contains your responses to the [survey](https://forms.gle/Txz92ytAmngd5TZy6) you took during this workshop. 

Here is the codebook for `responses`:

- `region`: Northeast, South, Midwest, West
- `school_level`: High School or Undergraduate
- `school_format`: How you're primarily attending school right now (In person or Online)
- `device_school`: Percentage of waking hours spent using electronic devices for school 
- `device_leisure`: Percentage of waking hours spent using electronic devices for leisure activities
- `social_media`: Which social media platforms you typically use

### Let's take look at the data

Run the code to view the first five rows of the data set.

```{r view-data, exercise = TRUE}
responses %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

## School

### School format

**How many students are high school students? College undergraduates?** To answer this question, we can use the `count` function to count the number of respondents at each level of `school_level`. 

```{r school-level-count, exercise = TRUE}
responses %>%
  count(school_level)
```

Now let's make a bar plot to visualize these counts! 

```{r school-level-bar, exercise  = TRUE}
ggplot(data = responses, aes(x = school_level)) +
  geom_bar() 
```

### Customize the bar plot

There are many ways to customize plots made with `ggplot`. For now, let's change the color of the bars and add a title. 

- To change the color of the bars, we'll include the  `fill = "[COLOR]"` inside `geom_bar()`. In the code below, you can see that we've changed the color of the bars to blue. 
- We'll add a title by including `labs()`. 

Update the code by replacing `blue` with a color of your choice and adding a title. You can [click here](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/42-colors-names.html) for a list of colors. 

```{r school-level-custom, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = responses, aes(x = school_level)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue") + 
  labs(title = "___")
```

### School format by level

**Are high school or undergraduates students more likely to be attending classes online?**

We can use the `group_by()` function to count number of students attending classes in person or online for each school level. 

```{r level-format-count, exercise = TRUE}
responses %>% 
  group_by(school_level) %>%
  count(school_format)
```

### Visualize school format by level

Let's visualize the relationship between `school_format` and `school_level`. We can update the original bar plot of `school_level` by filling in the color of the bars based on `school_format`. 

Since we want to fill in the color of the bars based on a variable (instead of making them the same color as before), we will 

- Include `fill = school_format` in the `aes`thetics
- Include `position = "fill"` in `geom_bar()`

Fill in the code to make a bar plot of `school_level` with the bars filled in based on `school_format`. This is a **stacked barplot**.  

```{r school-level-stacked, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = responses, aes(x = school_level, fill = ___)) +
  geom_bar(position = "___") +
  labs(title = "___")
```

### Your Turn! 

**Is there a relationship between where students live and whether they are attending classes in person or online?**

Start by counting the number of students attending school in person and online by region. 

```{r school-format-region, exercise = TRUE}
## count of school_format by region

```

Then, make a stacked bar chart of  `region`, filling in the color based on `school_format`. 

```{r region-school, exercise = T}
#bar plot of school format vs. region 

```


**What are some similarities and differences you observe about the way students in each region are attending school?**

## Electronic devices

What's the relationship between the percentage of time you use an electronic device for school versus for leisure activities in your free time? 

Let's make a scatterplot to find out!

### `device_school` versus `device_leisure`

We can use `geom_point()` to make scatterplots in `ggplot`. 

Run the code below to make a scatterplot of time you use electronic devices for school versus leisure. 

```{r time-on-device, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = responses, aes(x = device_school, y = device_leisure)) +
  geom_point()
```

### `device_school` versus `device_leisure` by `school_level`

Does the relationship between `device_school` and `device_leisure` differ for high school and college students?

To find out, we can add `color = group_var` to the `aes`thetic, where `group_var` is the variable we want to color by.  

Fill in the code to color the points on the scatterplot by `school_level` and add axis labels and a title.

```{r time-on-device-2, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = responses, aes(x = device_school, y = device_leisure, color = ___)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "___", 
      y = "___", 
      title = "___")
```

### Facet by school format

Do the observations we've made about electronic device use differ based on region?  

Let's add a `facet_wrap` to look at separate scatterplots based on school level. 

```{r time-on-device-3, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = responses, aes(x = device_school, y = device_leisure, color = school_level)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(school_format)) + 
  labs(x = "% time using device for school", 
      y = "% time using device for leisure", 
      title = "Time spent using device for school vs. leisure for HS and college students", 
      subtitle = "Faceted by class format")
```

### Your turn!

Does the relationship between device usage for school versus leisure activities differ for students attending school in person versus online? Is this relationship different for students who live in different regions? 

Start by making a scatterplot of `device_school` versus `device_lesiure` with the color based on `school_format`. 
Then update the plot by faceting by `region`. 

```{r time-on-device-4, exercise = TRUE}
# add your code here!

```

**What are some observations about the way students use electronic devices? How do these observations differ based on school level, school format, and region?**

## Facebook

Do a majority of students here use Facebook? 

We can use the `social_media` variable to answer help answer this question. Let's take a look at this variable using the `select` function.

```{r facebook-1, exercise = TRUE}
responses %>%
  select(social_media)
```

### Use `str_detect` to identify Facebook users

Respondents could select multiple social media platform, so we need a way to figure out whether Facebook is included in their answer. 

To do so, we'll use the `str_detect` and `mutate` functions  to create a new variable identifying whether the respondent uses Facebook. 

- `str_detect`: returns the value **TRUE** if "Facebook" is included in `social_media` and **FALSE** otherwise.
- `mutate`: Add the new variable to the data set

Run the code below to create the variable `facebook`. 

```{r facebook-2, exercise = TRUE}
responses <- responses %>%
  mutate(facebook  = str_detect(social_media, "Facebook"))
```

Now let's take a look at the data. 

```{r facebook-3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "facebook-2"}
responses %>%
  select(social_media, facebook)
```

### Visualize `facebook`

Let's make a bar plot to visualize `facebook`.

```{r facebook-4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "facebook-2"}

```

### Facebook and `device_leisure`

Are facebook users more likely to spend more time using their device for leisure? To answer this question, we'll make a histogram of `device_leisure` faceted by `facebook. 

```{r facebook-hist, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "facebook-2"}
ggplot(data = ___, aes(x = ___, color = facebook)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(___)
```

## Your turn! 

Choose another social media platform in from the survey and visualize the responses!

You can choose from 

- "Instagram" 
- "Twitter"
- "Snapchat"
- "Other"
- "None/ I don't use social media"

### Make a new variable

Fill in the code below to use the `str_detect` and `mutate` functions to create a new variable. 

```{r social-media, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "facebook-2"}
responses <- ___ %>%
  ___(str_detect(___, "___"))
```

Take a look at your new variable

```{r social-media-2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "facebook-2"}
___ %>%
  select(social_media, ___)
```

### Visualize it! 

Make a bar plot of your social media variable and customize the plot! 

```{r social-media-3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "social-media-2"}
# make a bar plot of your social media variable

```

### Relationship between variables

Now make a plot of explore the relationship between your social media variable and any of other variables we've used in this analysis!

```{r social-media-4,exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "social-media-2" }
## Make a plot to visualize the relationship

```
