#### [Dr. Maria Tackett](https://www.mariatackett.net/)

I am an Assistant Professor of the Practice in the Department of
Statistical Science at Duke University. My research focuses on using
technology and active learning techniques to enhance student learning
and motivation in large undergraduate statistics courses. Prior to
joining the faculty at Duke, I earned a Ph.D. in Statistics from the
University of Virginia, where my research focused on using a Bayesian
approach to quantify uncertainty in forensic science techniques, with an
emphasis on latent fingerprint evidence.
