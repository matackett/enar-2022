#### [Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel](http://mine-cr.com/)

I am Senior Lecturer in Statistics and Data Science in the School of
Maths at the University of Edinburgh, Associate Professor of the
Practice in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University,
and Professional Educator and Data Scientist at RStudio. I received my
Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles. My
work focuses on innovation in statistics and data science pedagogy, with
an emphasis on computing, reproducible research, student-centered
learning, and open-source education.

#### [Dr. Maria Tackett](https://www.mariatackett.net/)

I am an Assistant Professor of the Practice in the Department of
Statistical Science at Duke University. My research focuses on using
technology and active learning techniques to enhance student learning
and motivation in large undergraduate statistics courses. Prior to
joining the faculty at Duke, I earned a Ph.D. in Statistics from the
University of Virginia, where my research focused on using a Bayesian
approach to quantify uncertainty in forensic science techniques, with an
emphasis on latent fingerprint evidence.
